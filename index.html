            <p>
              Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. 
              </p>
              <p>Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. <p> Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible, inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea, but to plant one.

            <h3>Shutter Island</h3>
            <p>
              In 1954, up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. 
            </p>
            <p>
              He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he thinks he's been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. 
            </p>
            <p>
              As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals "escape" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity.

            <h3>Planet of Apes</h3>
            <p>
              In the year A.D. 3978, a spaceship with a crew of 4 crashes on a distant planet. One of the crew members had died in space, and the other 3 head out to explore the planet. 
            </p>
             <p> 
              They soon learn that the planet is much like their own. They then find the planet is inhabited by intelligent apes. One of the men is shot and killed, and the others are taken to the apes' city. 
            </p>
            <p>
              There, one undergoes brain surgery and is put into a state of living death. The other befriends some of the apes but is feared by most. After being put through ape trial, he escapes with a female human native to the planet. 
             </p> 
             <p>
              After helping his ape friends escape a religious heresy trial, he escapes out into the wilderness with the female. There he learns the planet might not be so distant after all.

                In its more elaborate, acrobatic form, diving originated in Europe early in the 19th century as a diversion of gymnasts and as a competitive sport in the late 19th century. It became a part of the swimming program of the Olympic Games in 1904 and developed rapidly through the first half of the 20th century.
